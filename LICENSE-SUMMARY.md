# DR_Admin Licensing Overview

DR_Admin is available under a **dual licensing model**.

## 1. Open Source License (Default)

- **License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 only (AGPL-3.0-only)
- **File:** `LICENSE.txt`

You can:
- Use DR_Admin free of charge
- Modify the source code
- Deploy it internally or as part of a service

But you must:
- License your derivative work under AGPL-3.0
- Provide complete corresponding source code to users who interact with the software over a network
- Include copyright and license notices

This license is ideal for:
- Open source projects
- Organizations that are comfortable sharing their modifications

## 2. Commercial License

- **License:** Proprietary commercial license
- **File:** `COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md` (summary only)

If you want to:
- Use DR_Admin in a **closed-source** or **proprietary** application
- Offer DR_Admin as part of a **SaaS** or hosting platform without releasing your source code
- Embed DR_Admin in a **commercial product** without AGPL obligations

…then you must obtain a **separate commercial license**.

### Key Benefits of the Commercial License

- No obligation to disclose your source code
- No AGPL copyleft effect on your application
- Ability to keep all modifications proprietary
- Optional access to commercial support and services (depending on agreement)

## 3. How to Choose

- If your project is **open source** and you are willing to share your code under AGPL-3.0 → use the **AGPL-3.0-only** license.
- If you are building a **commercial, closed-source, or SaaS** product and do **not** want to share your source → contact us for a **commercial license**.
